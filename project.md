# Final Project

## Goals

There are two goals of having this final project

- it provides an opportunity to practice what we learn in class about learning theory and algorithms
- it encourages the students to think about something beyond the course materials

## Project topics

Students can choose any of the following two **types** of project ideas [[Adopted from Stanford CS 229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html)]

- Application project: pick an application problem that interests you and explore how to find the best learning algorithms to solve it. 
- Algorithmic project: Pick a machine learning problem, then (1) develop a new algorithm to solve this problem or (2) design a variant of an existing algorithm that can provide a better solution.

## Project proposal

Please use [this template]() to write the project proposal and submit the pdf version. 

A project proposal should include the following sections

1. **Problem definition**: usually an easy way to provide a problem definition is to specify
	- Input of the problem: e.g., in text classification, the input is usually a document or sentence
	- Output of the problem: e.g., in text classification, the output is the *label set* of the input text
	- The motivation of choosing this problem
2. **Proposed Idea**: depends on the type of your project
	- If it is an application project, the proposed idea should be a concrete plan of exploring some learning algorithms to solve this problem
	- If it is an algorithmic project, the proposed idea should identify the challenge of solving the machine learning problem and also the common limitation of existing algorithms 
	- Expected outcome: briefly describe what you would like to see after finishing this project. This applies to **both** types of projects.
3. **Related work**: you should be able to identify at least **three** related works in this section. For each related work, 
	- describe why the work in this paper can be used to solve the proposed problem, if it is an application project
	- describe what is the specific issues of the work proposed in this paper and how your proposed idea can address these issues
4. **Timeline**
	- Describe what you plan to in each two weeks till the end of the semester
